Users are part of an organization. If you are a system administrator, you can manage users in the organization, including inviting users, removing users, and editing user permissions. This article describes how to manage users.

### Preconditions

- An organization has been created or joined. For more information, see [Managing Organizations](https://github-com.translate.goog/9z-ghj/Docs/blob/v1_0_0/docs/account/manage_organization.md?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=ja&_x_tr_pto=wapp) .
